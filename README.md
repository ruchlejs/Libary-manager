# ðŸ“š Library Manager

**Library Manager** is a simple command-line application written in C++ that allows users to manage a collection of media. This project is designed to help practice core C++ programming concepts such as classes, vectors, and user input handling.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

This project serves as an introduction to:

- Working with **C++ classes and objects**
- Managing dynamic collections using **vectors**
- Handling **user input** in a console-based application

## ðŸ§© Features

The library can manage two types of media: **books** and **films**. You can interact with them through the following features:
